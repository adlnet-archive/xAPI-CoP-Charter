<a name="purpose"/>
###1.  Purpose of COP

The [Domain Area] Community of Practice (CoP) charter documents information required by decision makers to approve and support the activities necessary for a successful launch, cultivation, and sustainability of the Community of Practice. The CoP charter includes the needs, scope, justification, and resource commitments.

The intended audience of the [Domain Area] Community of Practice community charter is the community sponsors, senior leadership, and the community members.

<a name="overview"/>
###2. CoP Overview

A CoP is a group of people connected by a common cause, role or purpose, which operates in a common modality. CoPS are a way of developing new knowledge, stimulating innovation, and sharing knowledge. Communities of practice knit people together with peers and their outputs can include leading practices, guidelines, knowledge repositories, technical problem and solution discussions, and strategies. Each xAPI CoP represents a group of professionals, informally bound to one another through a common classification of xAPI vocabulary requirements and common pursuit of solutions to satisfy those requirements. 

[Your overview should explain the reason for the community to exist. Consider

- What is the long-term and short-term value of the CoP to community members?  The larger xAPI community?
- What learning opportunities will members have after joining?
- How will this greater knowledge enhance the domain area?] 

<a name="justification"/>
## 3. Justification

<a name="xapi"/>
### 3.1 Experience API (xAPI)

The xAPI specification was written to be flexible enough to meet the varying use cases of the eLearning community. This flexibility can lead to a degradation of interoperability if CoPs do not agree to certain conventions. These conventions and rules on how to use the xAPI can be decided upon by each CoP and applied to the base xAPI specification as profiles.

The xAPI CoPS will generate a controlled vocabulary lists and design profiles. Some xAPI CoPS may also leverage the work from external CoPs, depending upon the domain area.
