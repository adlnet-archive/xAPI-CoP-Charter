xAPI Community of Practice (CoP) Charter Template README
================

This is a github version of the xAPI CoP Charter Template. For more information about the xAPI Community of Practice (CoP), visit http://xapi.adlnet.gov/xapi-cop-directory/

Experience API (xAPI) Community of Practice (CoP) charters, developed by each CoP, include the mission, scope, objectives, and other purposes of the group. This template will serve as a starting point with the expectation that the needs of your CoP, and therefore the charter itself, may change over time. Each CoP may add, edit, or remove information/sections to meet the needs of the CoP. 

This document should be drafted, facilitated, and finalized by each CoP's steering committee. The steering committee will be appointed at the initial meeting of the CoP.

Please note the following:

- Text surrounded by brackets [] should be updated to with your specific CoP name.
- All text included is optional and is as an example â€“ you are not required to use any of the text shown in this template
